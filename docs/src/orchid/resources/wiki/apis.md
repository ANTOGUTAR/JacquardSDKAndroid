## Guiding principles
The Jacquard SDK provides an easy way to interact with Jacquard tags and gear, handling all the aspects of Bluetooth and our hardware protocol. In common with any SDK dealing with hardware, using the Jacquqard SDK requires dealing with a lot of asynchronous events. The Jacquard teamâ€™s experience with this and other products has informed the design of this SDK to help you with this complexity. If you follow the patterns in our sample code you will avoid many common pitfalls and edge cases.

### Making invalid state unrepresentable
The principle coined and popularized by Yaron Minsky of making illegal states unrepresentable is very relevant to a hardware SDK. The goal is that the SDK should be difficult to use incorrectly. Achieving this goal takes careful API design, and we welcome any feedback about cases where you find we have missed the mark.

There are two main tools we use to achieve this. The first is using the Swift type system to reflect instance capabilities and requirements. The second is using Combine to provide a pattern where attempting to use a stale or disconnected Tag instance is precluded (more on this in the next section).

## Connecting to Tags
A JacquardManager instance allows you to find advertising Jacquard tags and connect to them, yielding a ConnectedTag instance (and an updated one any time the connection is lost and reconnected). This ConnectedTag instance is what you will use to access the tag and gear functionality.

## ConnectedTag
Once you have obtained a ConnectedTag instance from the connect publisher you can use it to send Commands and subscribe to Notifications. Some commands work with just a connection to the Tag, others require Jacquard garment or gear attached - the attachment state can also be observed via the ConnectedTag.
