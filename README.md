## Getting started
Jacquard&#8482; by Google weaves new digital experiences into the things you
love, wear, and use every day to give you the power to do more and be
more.  Jacquard SDK is a way to connect Jacquard interactions within
your apps.  Create an app and bring it to life with swipes and taps
through the Jacquard SDK.

## What do I need to get started?
The Android Jacquard SDK supports Android versions 23 and greater.

You will need the Jacquard Tag with a supported Jacquard product (all come with one tag). Currently supported products are:

- Levi's Trucker Jacket
- Samsonite Konnect-i backpack
- Saint Laurent Cit-e Backpack
You can find links to purchase these products on the [Google Jacquard website](https://atap.google.com/jacquard/products/).

> If you have just opened a new retail Jacquard product, your tag
> probably needs a firmware update (and perhaps charging). Review the
> steps in the [Updating
> Firmware](https://google.github.io/JacquardSDKAndroid/wiki/firmware_update/)
> page.

## Sample App
To run the example project, clone the repo, and run the Android project from the `sample` directory first. For more detailed instructions, see the full documentation.

## Next Steps
The best way to get started with the Jacquard SDK is to follow our tutorial.

Once you have completed the tutorial, the best place to go next is the API Overview which will explain the features of your Jacquard tag and gear, and how to use the API. After that, check out the API Documentation (available in the table of contents on the left of every page) and build your awesome app :)
